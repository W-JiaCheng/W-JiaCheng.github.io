I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working under the supervision of Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/). My research interests primarily focus on wireless sensing, Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC), generative AI, and semantic communications.

Prior to my current position, I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Communications and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2022. During my doctoral studies, I spent a year (2021-2022) as a visiting student at NTU's College of Computing and Data Science.

My research primarily centers around **Wireless Sensing and Generative AI**. Our key objectives include:

1. Wireless Sensing:
   - Through-the-wall detection and localization
   - CSI-based human activity recognition
   - Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)

2. Generative AI for Communications:
   - Generative AI-assisted wireless sensing
   - Semantic communications
   - Edge intelligence and network optimization
