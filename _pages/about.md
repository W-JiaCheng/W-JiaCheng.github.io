I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working under the supervision of Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/). My research interests primarily focus on wireless sensing, Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC), generative AI, and semantic communications. Before my current position, I received my Ph.D. degree (Supervised by [Prof. Zengshan Tian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XkAhc2AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)) from the School of Communications and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2022. From 2021 to 2022, I was a visiting student at the College of Computing and Data Science, NTU, Singapore. My research primarily centers around **Wireless Sensing and Generative AI**, including

1. Wireless Sensing:
   - Signal processing for wireless sensing
   - CSI-based human detection, localization, and activity recognition
   - Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)

2. Generative AI (GenAI) for wireless sensing and communications:
   - Generative AI-assisted signal processing for wireless sensing
   - Generative AI-enabled Semantic communications
   - Generative AI-based edge intelligence and network optimization for ISAC
